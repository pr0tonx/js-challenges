/*
In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided dice. If you
advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.

Given you and your friend's tile number, create a function that returns if it's possible to earn a bonus when you roll
the dice.

Examples
possibleBonus(3, 7) ➞ true

possibleBonus(1, 9) ➞ false

possibleBonus(5, 3) ➞ false

Notes
You cannot move backward (which is why example #3 doesn't work).
If you are already on the same tile, return false, as you would be advancing away.
Expect only positive integer inputs.

function possibleBonus(a, b) {
const bonus = b - a;

return bonus > 0 && bonus <= 6;
}

console.log(possibleBonus(5, 3));
